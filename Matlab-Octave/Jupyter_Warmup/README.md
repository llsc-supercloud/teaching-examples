# Running JupyterWarmup_Octave Notebook

These Jupyter Notebook and supporting files in this repository are intended to provide the learner with a brief introduction to working with Octave/MATLAB in a Jupyter Notebook.  Support for Octave/MATLAB is not standard for Jupyter and thus requires the inclusion of an additional kernel.  The instructions below provide the steps necessary for running these notebooks on the MIT Supercloud, where Octave Jupyter Notebooks are supported, and an outline of the steps for running the notebooks on a stand-alone desktop system.  Please follow the appropriate set of instructions for your computing resources.

Please note that the MIT Supercloud is available for researchers who are part of the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center and/or are working in collaboration with MIT.  


## MIT Supercloud

1. The notebooks and supporting files are on the MIT Supercloud so you can either copy them to your home directory on Supercloud or download the files from this repository to your home directory on Supercloud.
2. Log into the Supercloud portal.
3. Start up a Jupyter instance.
   1. Click on the Jupter Link.
   2. Select "Launch Jupyter Notebook" to launch with defaults option or select "Show Advanced Launch Options" and select what you need. This notebook does not require any advanced options.
   3. Click on the "Open Notebook" link to open Jupyter.
4. You will see a list of directories/folders in your home directory which you can click on to navigate through. Navigate to the location where you copied/downloaded the notebook files.
5. Start up the notebook by clicking the JupyterWarmup_Octave.ipynb file.


## Personal Desktop/Laptop:

1. Install the octave_kernel for Jupyter.  The information on installing the kernel and its dependencies can be found at: https://github.com/Calysto/octave_kernel.
2. Download the notebook and supporting files from this repository.
3. Start Jupyter. You will see a list of directories/folders which you can click on to navigate through. Navigate to the directory with JupyterWarmup_Octave.ipynb and click to open.
