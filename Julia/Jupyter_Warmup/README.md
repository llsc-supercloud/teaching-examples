# Running JupyterWarmup_Julia Notebook

These Jupyter Notebook and supporting files in this repository are intended to provide the learner with a brief introduction to working with Julia in a Jupyter Notebook.  Support for Julia is not standard for Jupyter and thus requires the inclusion of an additional kernel.  The instructions below provide the steps necessary for running these notebooks on the MIT Supercloud, where Julia Jupyter Notebooks are supported, and an outline of the steps for running the notebooks on a stand-alone desktop system.  Please follow the appropriate set of instructions for your computing resources.

Please note that the MIT Supercloud is available for researchers who are part of the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center and/or are working in collaboration with MIT.  


## MIT Supercloud

1. The notebooks and supporting files are on the MIT Supercloud so you can either copy them to your home directory on Supercloud or download the files from this repository to your home directory on Supercloud.
2. Log into the Supercloud portal.
3. Start up a Jupyter instance.
   1. Click on the Jupter Link.
   2. Select "Show Advanced Launch Options" and select "Anaconda 5.0.1 - Python 3.6" from the Anaconda/Python Version dropdown. This notebook does not require any additional advanced options.
   3. Click on the "Open Notebook" link to open Jupyter.
4. You will see a list of directories/folders in your home directory which you can click on to navigate through. Navigate to the location where you copied/downloaded the notebook files.
5. Start up the notebook by clicking the JupyterWarmup_Julia.ipynb file.


## Personal Desktop/Laptop:
