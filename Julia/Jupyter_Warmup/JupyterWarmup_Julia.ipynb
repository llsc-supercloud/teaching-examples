    "    * Save your notebook or text file by clicking File->Save or CMD+S/Control+S.\n",
    "    * Save important data or results as files on the filesystem. Work save or write commands into your code wherever you produce an important result. In Julia you can save in a text file, or save Julia variables using the JLD or MAT packages.\n",
    "    * See [Section 3.2](#Saving-Data-and-Variables) for more information.\n",
    "3. Export your notebook as a script.\n",
    "    * When your are done developing your code and just need to run it without making too many edits, export your notebook as a script.\n",
    "    * Save your notebook before exporting to get any recent changes.\n",
    "    * In Octave/MATLAB, you can type `system('jupyter nbconvert --to script JupyterWarmup_Julia.ipynb')` in a code block to export from within the notebook. Be sure to remove this line from your Octave/MATLAB script before running it.\n",
    "    * See [Section 4](#Exporting-your-Notebook-as-a-Script) for more information.\n",
    "4. Know when to use a batch job.\n",
    "    * Jupyter notebooks are great for development and running interactive analysis, but if you have long running code you may want to submit that code as a batch job instead.\n",
    "    * Batch jobs will run the code you submit and exit independent of user input.\n",
    "    * Export your notebook as a script use as a starting point for a batch job.\n",
    "    * See [this page](https://supercloud.mit.edu/submitting-jobs) for more information on running batch jobs.\n",
    "    * You can use the Jupyter Terminal to submit batch jobs, or submit from the login node through a terminal on your desktop.\n",
