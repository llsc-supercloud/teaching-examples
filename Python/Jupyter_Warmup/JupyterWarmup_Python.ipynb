    "Most Linux commands deal with *directories* and *files*. A *directory*, synonymous to a folder, contains files and other directories.

    "Anytime after you start typing a Linux command you can press the \"Tab\" button your your keyboard. This called tab-complete, and will try to autocomplete what you are typing. This is particularly helpful when typing out long directory paths and file names. Pressing \"Tab\" once will complete if there is a single completion, pressing it twice will list all potential completions. It is a bit difficult to explain in text, but you can try it out yourself and watch the short demnstration [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_completion).\n",

    "* Creating, navigating and viewing directories:\n",
    "    * `pwd`: tells you the full path of the directory you are currently in\n",
    "    * `mkdir dirname`: creates a directory with the name \"dirname\"\n",
    "    * `cd dirname`: change directory to directory \"dirname\"\n",
    "    * `cd ../`: takes you up one level\n",
    "    * `ls`: lists the files in the directory\n",
    "        * `ls -a`: lists all files including hidden files\n",
    "        * `ls -l`: lists files in \"long format\" including ownership and date of last update\n",
    "        * `ls -t`: lists files by date stamp, most recently updated file first\n",
    "        * `ls -tr`: lists files by dates stamp in reverse order, most recently updated file is listed last (this is useful if you have a lot of files, you want to know which file you changed last and the list of files results in a scrolling window)\n",
    "        * `ls dirname`: lists the files in the directory \"dirname\"\n",
    "* Viewing files\n",
    "    * `more filename`: shows the first part of a file, hitting the space bar allows you to scroll through the rest of the file, q will cause you to exit out of the file\n",
    "    * `less filename`: allows you to scroll through the file, forward and backward, using the arrow keys\n",
    "    * `tail filename`: shows the last 10 lines of a file (useful when you are monitoring a logfile or output file to see that the values are correct)\n",
    "        * `tail -&lt;number\\> filename`: show you the last &lt;number> lines of a file.\n",
    "        * `tail -f filename`: shows you new lines as they are written to the end of a file. Press CMD+C or Control+C to exit.\n",
    "* Copying, moving, renaming, and deleting files\n",
    "    * `mv filename dirname`: moves filename to directory dirname.\n",
    "        * `mv filename1 filename2`: moves filename1 to filename2, in essence renames the file. The date and time are not changed by the mv command.\n",
    "    * cp filename dirname: copies to directory dirname.\n",
    "        * `cp filename1 filename2`: copies filename1 to filename2. The date stamp on filename2 will be the date/time that the file was moved\n",
    "    * `rm filename`: removes (deletes) the file"

    "In this section we summarize some important take-aways that will help you be successful using Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Shut down your notebooks when you are done.\n",
    "    * Notebooks on the MIT Supercloud take up computing resources. When you leave Jupyter running, you are leaving resources occupied that could be used by someone else. \n",
    "    * To shut down your notebook, click on the \"Shutdown\" button in the top right of every Jupyter page, or click the \"Shutdown\" button on the [Jupyter launching page](https://txe1-portal.mit.edu/jupyter/jupyter_notebook.php).\n",
    "    * Make sure you save your notebooks and any important data before shutting down!\n",
    "    * See section 1 for more information.\n",
    "2. Save frequently.\n",
    "    * Save your notebook or text file by clicking File->Save or CMD+S/Control+S.\n",
    "    * Save important data or results as files on the filesystem. Work save or write commands into your code wherever you produce an important result. In Python you can save in a text file, or use `np.save()` or `np.savez()`.\n",
    "    * See section 3.2 for more information.\n",
    "3. Export your notebook as a script.\n",
    "    * When your are done developing your code and just need to run it without making too many edits, export your notebook as a script.\n",
    "    * Save your notebook before exporting to get any recent changes.\n",
    "    * In python, you can type `!jupyter nbconvert --to script JupyterWarmup_python.ipynb` in a code block to export from within the notebook. Be sure to remove this line from your Python script before running it.\n",
    "    * See section 4 for more information.\n",
    "4. Know when to use a batch job.\n",
    "    * Jupyter notebooks are great for development and running interactive analysis, but if you have long running code you may want to submit that code as a batch job instead.\n",
    "    * Batch jobs will run the code you submit and exit independent of user input.\n",
    "    * Export your notebook as a script use as a starting point for a batch job.\n",
    "    * See [this page](https://supercloud.mit.edu/submitting-jobs) for more information on running batch jobs.\n",
    "    * You can use the Jupyter Terminal to submit batch jobs, or submit from the login node through a terminal on your desktop.\n",
    "    * See section 1.1 for more information."
