# Running JupyterWarmup_Python Notebook

These Jupyter Notebook and supporting files in this repository are intended to provide the learner with a brief introduction to working with Python in a Jupyter Notebook.  The instructions below provide the steps necessary for running these notebooks on the MIT Supercloud and an outline of the steps for running the notebooks on a stand-alone desktop system.  Please follow the appropriate set of instructions for your computing resources.

Please note that the MIT Supercloud is available for researchers who are part of the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center and/or are working in collaboration with MIT.  These notebooks were created with the MIT Supercloud and Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center (LLSC) in mind, and so some of the best practices may not be relevant to running Jupyter on a desktop, particularly instructions on how to down your instance. We have replace the "Logout" button in Jupyter with "Shutdown", which shuts down your entire Jupyter instance.


## MIT Supercloud

1. The notebooks and supporting files are on the MIT Supercloud so you can either copy them to your home directory on Supercloud or download the files from this repository to your home directory on Supercloud.
2. Log into the Supercloud portal.
3. Start up a Jupyter instance.
   1. Click on the Jupyter Link.
   2. Select "Show Advanced Launch Options" and select "Anaconda 5.0.1 - Python 3.6" from the Anaconda/Python Version dropdown. This notebook does not require any additional advanced options.
   3. Click on the "Open Notebook" link to open Jupyter.
4. You will see a list of directories/folders in your home directory which you can click on to navigate through. Navigate to the location where you copied/downloaded the notebook files.
5. Start up the notebook by clicking the JupyterWarmup_Python.ipynb file.


## Personal Desktop/Laptop:

1. Follow the instructions to download and install Jupyter: https://jupyter.org/install. Note that this notebook uses Python 3.
2. Download the notebook and supporting files from this repository.
3. Start Jupyter. You will see a list of directories/folders which you can click on to navigate through. Navigate to the directory with JupyterWarmup_Python.ipynb and click to open.
